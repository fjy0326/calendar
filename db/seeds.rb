# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

10.times do |i|
  Event.create!(
    title: "サンプルイベント#{i+1}",
    start: Time.zone.now + i.days,
    end: Time.zone.now + i.days + 1.hour
  )
